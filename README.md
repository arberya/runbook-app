# RunBook

RunBook is a simple web application for documenting, mananging, and executing operations Run Books.

It is aimed at system administrators and DevOps who perform manual routine tasks, helping them to do so more reliabily and with less scope for human error.

## What is a Run Book?

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runbook) describes a RunBook as:

>A routine compilation of the procedures and operations which the administrator or operator of the system carries out. Runbooks are often used in information technology departments of commercial companies and NOCs as a reference for system administrators. Runbooks can be in either electronic or in physical book form. Typically, a runbook will contain the procedures to begin, stop, and supervise the system. It can also contain descriptions for the handling of special requests and of contingencies. An effective runbook will allow other operators, with prerequisite expertise, to effectively manage and troubleshoot a system. Through runbook automation, these processes can be carried out using software tools in a predetermined manner."

## Shouldn't this stuff be automated?

All DevOps love automation.  Scripting and automating tasks around the deployment and management of your software is faster, more repeatable, more reliable, and less work than doing the same thing manually.

However, what about those tasks which, for whatever reason, you cannot automate?

Perhaps you have a lack of automated testing, or use some vendor software without an API, or simply haven't had the time to script and harden the process.

These processes are carried out by humans as nanual steps:
